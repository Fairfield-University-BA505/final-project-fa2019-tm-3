    "    - These results indicate that the advertising of movies to people should not matter based on their music taste\n",
    "    - Due to the low correlations found in our research, we would not deploy our results for the reationship between Pop, Rock, HipHop/Rap, Latin and Techno music and Action, Animated, SciFi, Romantic, Comedy movies because they are not statistically significant. \n",

    "    - bar graph/ scatter plot\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Is there a connection between music and movie preferences?**\n",

    "2. Finding correlations with so much data.\n",
    "3. Determining the best way to represent/display these outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results Expected to Present**\n",
    "We expect that the type of music a person listens to will explain more about them. While we expect to see certain patters of behavior, such as a correlation between a person's movie preference and preferred genre of music, we also anticipate to come across some surprises that may not fit the stereotypical ideals. \n",
